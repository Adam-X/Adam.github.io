I was an intern at Tencent AI Lab <img src='images/Tencent.png' style='width: 3.5em;'>, mainly doing research on speech and music, supervised by [Yi Luo (罗艺)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OSM9xooAAAAJ&hl=en).

I got my bachelor's degree from Department of Computer Technology and Application, Qinghai University, supervised by Prof. [Jianqiang Huang (黄建强)](https://www.qhu-hdacp.cn/hjq.html) and Prof. [Chunmei Li (李春梅)](https://cs.qhu.edu.cn/jxgz/jxysz/ssyjsds/57658.htm)
